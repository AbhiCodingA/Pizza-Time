# Pizza Time

Pizza Time: A delicious online experience. I designed and developed an e-commerce platform for this pizza restaurant, featuring an interactive menu with a variety of options including pizza, sushi, and pasta. Simplifying the online ordering process and providing a seamless user experience was the key goal of this project.

A e-commerce platform tailored for the gastronomy industry. I led end-to-end design and development, utilizing technologies like React Icons, React Router DOM, React Alice Carousel, Leaflet Maps, React Paginate, UUID, React Lazy Load, and Framer Motion.
